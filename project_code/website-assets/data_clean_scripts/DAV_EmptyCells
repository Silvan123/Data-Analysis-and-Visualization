# A couple of options to deal with empty cells.


# First off, let's replace empty cells. Let's look at the n_guns_involved column.
# Use dfList.fillna(0) to replace all empty cells with a "0".

# Read csv file as df(dataframe)
df = pd.read_csv('AllGunShootings.csv')

# Convert column into dataframe (use df['columnname'].tolist() for a list-format!)
dfList = df['n_guns_involved']

# Fill emty cells with a "0".
dfList=dfList.fillna(0)
print(dfList)

# It is also possible to simply exlude all rows where a certain cell is empty,
# using the pd.notnull function.
# It is possible to filter out all empty cells in different row by redoing the
# function multiple times.
df = df[pd.notnull(df['n_guns_involved'])]
df = df[pd.notnull(df['participant_age'])]
df = df[pd.notnull(df['participant_relationship'])]

# It is also possible to choose which columns you want to print/select.
df1 = df[['state','city_or_county', 'n_guns_involved']]

# Prints the altered 'state' and 'city_or_county' columns.
print(df1)
